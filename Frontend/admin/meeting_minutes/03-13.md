## Location
S16-0431

## Participants
All members of the front-end team

## Topics discussed
Interview questions for students looking to study any of the 6 data science courses shortlisted, 
design low-fidelity prototype

## Main discussion
1. Physical interview: came up with questions to ask 5 students looking to study data science. The questions cover the following areas:
    - Do the students know what data science is?
    - What do students look for in a university if they want to study data science?
    - What are some problems that they face when going through the data science page of each university?
    - What are the information that they want to know but canâ€™t find on the university page - for example, the difficulty of the modules and the programming languages required.
2. The interview must be completed by 17 March so that we have enough time to conclude the interview results, and to complete the high-fidelity prototype (see point 3.). 
3. Completed Low-Fidelity prototype. We will complete the High-Fidelity Prototype on 20 March when we have more information from the interviews to decide on which features to add, remove or modify. 

### Next meetings and action plan: 
- 17 March 12pm to consolidate interview results within the team
- 19 March 10pm to go through interview results with back-end team
- 20 March to build high-fidelity prototype
