# 19 March, 10-11pm

## Location
Zoom

## Participants
All 8 members of project team

## Topics discussed
Interview results, new features for webpage and model based on interview results

## Main discussion
1. Shared the consolidated interview results of the 5 students the front-end team has interviewed with the back-end team
2. Based on the interview results, we require new features:
    - A brief explanation on how the ranking of the universities work after the student keys in the job description
        - Front-end: the webpage should explain why a university is ranked high or low.
        - Back-end: there should be an output from the model that explains why a university is ranked high or low.
    - Webpage updates
        - Front-end: we need another chart showing how many theoretical and practical modules a university has
    - A network graph for each school. This graph will focus on identifying important modules, such as prerequisite modules or modules that bridge different fields.
        - The Back-end team will come up with the graph
    - Data required for the charts on the webpage
        - Back-end: data for the number of statistics, computer science and mathematics modules a university student studying data science has to take and salary data for a second chart on the webpage
3. Action plan for the front-end team, to be completed within the next 1.5 weeks so that we can sync with the back-end:
    - Update low-fidelity prototype and create high-fidelity prototype 
    - Implement webpage

### Next meetings and action plan: 
- 20 March to build high-fidelity prototype and to delegate work in building our webpage
