117,"Research Assistant, - (Data Analyst), - #WorkNow #Immediate",Nanyang Technological University,"The Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) invites applications for the position of Research Assistant. The provision of safe drinking water is of upmost national importance. Engineered water systems (such as drinking water distribution and HVAC systems) contain consortia of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances referred to as biofilms. Biofilms have been shown to harbor a broad variety of microorganisms associated with corrosion of the pipe material, lead to the breakdown of residual disinfectants like monochloramine, and are known to support the growth of opportunistic waterborne pathogens. In previous projects, an array of sensor nodes was established wirelessly in the drinking water distribution networks (DWDS) of two campuses in Singapore, measuring water quality and leak-detection associated parameters in real-time, and providing easy access to the network. More recently, a simulated Intermittent Water Distribution system and laboratory scale HVAC / chiller unit circles have been established and will be the foundation of in-depth research into the impact of hydraulic and physicochemical conditions on the formation of potentially hazardous biofilms and their microbial composition. We are looking for a self-driven, committed, and inquisitive Data Analyst to join our drinking water distribution team at SCELSE. In addition to the in-depth analysis and visualization of data obtained from the various operational and simulated water systems, the candidate will develop and validate molecular assays (generating positive and negative controls, designing, and calculating standard curves, determining recovery rates and inhibition factors) and microfluidic-based methods to detect bacterial indicator organisms. The candidate will also be involved in laboratory and field operations such as biofilm and bulk water sampling as well as housekeeping tasks such as ongoing quality control for the methods used. A wide array of novel techniques will be used (e.g., whole genome and 16S rRNA metabarcoding sequencing and microfluidic flow cytometry) and the candidate will get insights into their application in a public health-related critical infrastructure. Key Responsibilities: Planning, organizing, and conducting outdoor sampling of three well-established DWDS testbeds to understand the impact of operational events on drinking water quality. Analyzing water quality parameters Application of a wide array of novel molecular techniques and methods (e.g., next generation sequencing and high-sensitivity flow cytometry) for the analysis of samples collected in DWDS Validation and maintenance of quality control for current workflow based on advanced bioinformatical approaches Application of a wide variety of data analysis tools (e.g., R, Python and Graphpad) to gain insights into microbial communities in water and their relationships with physicochemical water quality parameters Interpretation and visualization of complex data sets Job Requirements: BSc in environmental engineering, data analysis or related disciplines. Advanced knowledge in collecting data, data processing and laboratory techniques. Basic understanding of biofilm biology, its relevance and detection methods. Experience in setting up and maintaining remote sensing equipment as well as experimental testbeds. An analytical mind and inclination for problem-solving. Experience in flow cytometry.

The provision of safe drinking water is of upmost national importance. Engineered water systems (such as drinking water distribution and HVAC systems) contain consortia of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances referred to as biofilms. Biofilms have been shown to harbor a broad variety of microorganisms associated with corrosion of the pipe material, lead to the breakdown of residual disinfectants like monochloramine, and are known to support the growth of opportunistic waterborne pathogens. In previous projects, an array of sensor nodes was established wirelessly in the drinking water distribution networks (DWDS) of two campuses in Singapore, measuring water quality and leak-detection associated parameters in real-time, and providing easy access to the network. More recently, a simulated Intermittent Water Distribution system and laboratory scale HVAC / chiller unit circles have been established and will be the foundation of in-depth research into the impact of hydraulic and physicochemical conditions on the formation of potentially hazardous biofilms and their microbial composition. We are looking for a self-driven, committed, and inquisitive Data Analyst to join our drinking water distribution team at SCELSE. In addition to the in-depth analysis and visualization of data obtained from the various operational and simulated water systems, the candidate will develop and validate molecular assays (generating positive and negative controls, designing, and calculating standard curves, determining recovery rates and inhibition factors) and microfluidic-based methods to detect bacterial indicator organisms. The candidate will also be involved in laboratory and field operations such as biofilm and bulk water sampling as well as housekeeping tasks such as ongoing quality control for the methods used. A wide array of novel techniques will be used (e.g., whole genome and 16S rRNA metabarcoding sequencing and microfluidic flow cytometry) and the candidate will get insights into their application in a public health-related critical infrastructure. Key Responsibilities: Planning, organizing, and conducting outdoor sampling of three well-established DWDS testbeds to understand the impact of operational events on drinking water quality.

272,"Research Assistant, - (Data Analyst), - #WorkNow #Immediate",Nanyang Technological University,"The Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) invites applications for the position of Research Assistant. The provision of safe drinking water is of upmost national importance. Engineered water systems (such as drinking water distribution and HVAC systems) contain consortia of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances referred to as biofilms. Biofilms have been shown to harbor a broad variety of microorganisms associated with corrosion of the pipe material, lead to the breakdown of residual disinfectants like monochloramine, and are known to support the growth of opportunistic waterborne pathogens. In previous projects, an array of sensor nodes was established wirelessly in the drinking water distribution networks (DWDS) of two campuses in Singapore, measuring water quality and leak-detection associated parameters in real-time, and providing easy access to the network. More recently, a simulated Intermittent Water Distribution system and laboratory scale HVAC / chiller unit circles have been established and will be the foundation of in-depth research into the impact of hydraulic and physicochemical conditions on the formation of potentially hazardous biofilms and their microbial composition. We are looking for a self-driven, committed, and inquisitive Data Analyst to join our drinking water distribution team at SCELSE. In addition to the in-depth analysis and visualization of data obtained from the various operational and simulated water systems, the candidate will develop and validate molecular assays (generating positive and negative controls, designing, and calculating standard curves, determining recovery rates and inhibition factors) and microfluidic-based methods to detect bacterial indicator organisms. The candidate will also be involved in laboratory and field operations such as biofilm and bulk water sampling as well as housekeeping tasks such as ongoing quality control for the methods used. A wide array of novel techniques will be used (e.g., whole genome and 16S rRNA metabarcoding sequencing and microfluidic flow cytometry) and the candidate will get insights into their application in a public health-related critical infrastructure. Key Responsibilities: Planning, organizing, and conducting outdoor sampling of three well-established DWDS testbeds to understand the impact of operational events on drinking water quality. Analyzing water quality parameters Application of a wide array of novel molecular techniques and methods (e.g., next generation sequencing and high-sensitivity flow cytometry) for the analysis of samples collected in DWDS Validation and maintenance of quality control for current workflow based on advanced bioinformatical approaches Application of a wide variety of data analysis tools (e.g., R, Python and Graphpad) to gain insights into microbial communities in water and their relationships with physicochemical water quality parameters Interpretation and visualization of complex data sets Job Requirements: BSc in environmental engineering, data analysis or related disciplines. Advanced knowledge in collecting data, data processing and laboratory techniques. Basic understanding of biofilm biology, its relevance and detection methods. Experience in setting up and maintaining remote sensing equipment as well as experimental testbeds. An analytical mind and inclination for problem-solving. Experience in flow cytometry.
