# Folder contents:

1. <b>Data Collection/</b> : This folder consists of notebooks created to collect data for training the NER and Word2Vec models. Two of the notebooks are web scrapers that collect job description text data from two popular job posting sites in Singapore. The last notebook interacts with the Lightcast API to collect description of skills related to the data science field. The instructions to run each notebook are laid out as MARKDOWN cells within the notebooks themselves.
2. <b>Graph/</b> : This folder consists of the code needed to build the network visualisations. More information is provided in the README.md file within this directory.
3. <b>NER Model/</b> : This folder consists of the code and resources needed to build the NER model. More information is provided in the README.md file within this directory. However, do note that the NER model requires the Word2Vec model to be trained first, as the training process of the NER model involves the word embeddings generated by the Word2Vec model.
4. <b>W2V Model/</b> : This folder consists of the code needed to build the Word2Vec model. More information is provided in the README.md file within this directory.
5. <b>analytics.ipynb</b> : This file consists of some analytics performed on the module descriptions by six of the local universities in Singapore.
