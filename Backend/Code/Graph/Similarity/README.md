1. <b>cosine_similarity.ipynb</b> : This code is designed to find similar university course modules using cosine similarity. The code first reads in course information from multiple universities, including NTU, SIT, NUS, SMU, SUSS, and SUTD, and selects the desired columns. Then, the code preprocesses the module descriptions by removing stop words and stemming the text. The preprocessed descriptions are used to generate a matrix of tf-idf scores, which is used to calculate the cosine similarity matrix for the tf-idf matrix. The find_similar_modules function then iterates over each pair of modules and calculates their cosine similarity scores. If the score is above a certain threshold, which is set to 0.2 by default, the function outputs the module codes, titles, and universities of the two similar modules along with their similarity score. This output helps identify similar modules across different universities, which may be useful for students interested in exploring different course options.
2. <b>Network for all Schools/</b> : This folder contains all the relevant files to generate the final interactive Gephi Network comprising nodes which represent all modules from all schools and edges representing how similar they are via cosine similarity. This includes:
a. The .gephi file <br>
b. similarity_edges.csv the edges file generated from cosine_similarity.ipynb<br>
c. similarity_nodes.csv the nodes file generated from cosine_similarity.ipynb<br>
3. <b>Filtered Networks for Individual Schools/</b> : This folder contains a filtered version of the main network for each individual school. These filtered graphs represent the modules offered by each school, and are color-coded according to their modularity class, with edges indicating the cosine similarity between them. In other words, the edges show how similar the modules are to each other in terms of content. This information can help students understand the broad focus of each school, such as whether they have a stronger emphasis on software engineering or mathematics, or whether they offer unique modules not found in other schools.
4. <b>LDA/</b> : We experimented with Latent Dirichlet allocation to do Topic Modelling for the graph, but we chose to stick with the Louvain method in Gephi as it gave us better results.
